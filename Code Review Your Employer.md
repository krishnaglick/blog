# Code Reviewing Your Employer

I've had this idea knocking around my head for a bit now.
You interview for a position that looks great on paper. They sell you on what cool stuff they're doing at the company. You sign up, and suddenly find yourself doing something you didn't expect.

I sure I'm not the only developer to encounter this. The potential employer wants to buy your talent, and while they probably aren't blatantly lying, there's a good chance they're not telling the whole story.

Hopefully you've negotiated well and even with this disapointment you've still gotten a solid raise out of it if nothing else, but there's still a problem.
You came in looking to write code you'd be passionate about and find yourself maintaining a legacy application or dealing with unexpected layers of bureaucracy. It happens, life isn't perfect, but it still sucks.

If I'm not working on something I enjoy, at least a little, I find it hard to motivate myself to work quickly. This is why I'm proposing this idea.

Don't sell me with words, sell me with code. It is, afterall, what you're going to be paying me for!

Given that I'm not a lawyer there will likely be legal ramifications to showing code to potential hirees, however I'm not sure they're unsurmountable. Letting a potential hiree look at your codebase would allow them to evaluate just how effective their coworkers will be, and what management deems important.

No tests? Spagetti code? Non-standard code due to inexperienced developers?
A strong developer will be able to look into the code and have an idea of what they're getting into. I believe this can benefit all involved parties.

The hiree will be able to judge if they _really_ want to work with the codebase, and could provide feedback to the employer regarding potential issues.
The employer could vet the skill of the hiree based on what they notice, and get external feedback on their codebase.

I feel like it's a win-win, but only if it's handled well.

Potential employers could exploit this _free_ labor in order to get feedback on their codebase from seniors, so there'd have to be some level of trust in place. And the legal documentation around this process would need to be reasonably simple to protect both parties while still being parsable.

Learning a new codebase isn't exactly the simpliest of tasks. Some companies provide monetary compensation to potential hirees for completing coding exercises, so maybe a similar system could be used.

I believe the idea has merit, but as with all things the devil is in the details.

A friend of mine has taken the route of request a 2-week contract with a hiring company, for about 20hr/week, in order for them to assess his skill, and he their code. It's worked well for him, it might do so for you!
